# What is bioinformatics?


# What is bioinformatics?

The application of computation towards the analysis of biological data


# In practice this entails

data munging | data exploration | drawing conclusions


# Data munging

This is where a lot of day to day work goes

* Cleaning data
* Transforming data


# Data exploration

* Visualize
* Build intuition
* Hypothesize


# Building conclusions

In which we shore things up to tell the world...

* Statistical analysis
* More visualization


# Rinse and repeat...

New insights and conclusions lead to new data and questions, etc.


# This should be nothing new

This is what you're likely _already_ doing at the lab bench, but with computers instead of test tubes.

The difference is in knowing how to approach scientific problems with the computational toolset.


# So this is _what_ we do

<br/>

## But _how_ should we do it?


# Specific goals for research

General goals for good science:

* Reproducibility
* Robustness
* Accuracy
* Clarity
* Iterability


# Things we can do towards these goals

Immutable data | Documentation | Automation


# Immutability

**Never** change data in place; data in, data out.

Aids: reproducibility, clarity & iterability


# Document **everything**

Hopefully you're already doing this with your biology work (lab notebook).

Bioinformatics should be no different.

* Software versions
* Settings used to run things
* Reasoning behind the way you do things
* How/when you got your data

Aids: reproducibility, clarity


# The best documentation is automation

Write _scripts_ (little computer programs) for everything:

* Munging
* Plotting
* Statistics
* Build scripts (tying it all together)

Aids: reproducibility, robustness, accuracy, iterability


# Guiding principals & practices towards this end

Unix philosophy | project/data organization


# The Unix Philosophy

* Small, composable tools that do one thing right
* Plumb tools together into pipelines & scripts
* Embrace plain-text data

Bioinformatics naturally embraces this.


# Project & data layout

Being consistent aids in automation & clarity

* naming schemes
* path schemes

_Note: I use a somewhat different organizational scheme than the book's author.
Find what works for you..._


# Project layout

Here's how I typically organize things:


```text
your-project
├── README.md
├── build.sh
├── data
│   ├── sequences.fasta
│   └── metadata.csv
├── scripts
│   ├── clean.py
│   └── plot.R
└── output
    ├── alignment.fasta
    ├── cleaned_metadata.csv
    ├── tree.newick
    └── tree_plot.png
```


# And if you have nested data...

```text
...
├── data
│   ├── trial-a
│   │   ├── sequences.fasta
│   │   └── metadata.csv
│   ├── trial-b
│   │   ├── sequences.fasta
│   │   └── metadata.csv
...
```

# More on Unix

Unix is a proprietary operating system from the 60s.

True Unix isn't frequently encountered these days, but its philosophy and approach to computing have thrived in "Unix-like" systems.
So much so that when we say "Unix", we usually mean it in the abstract sense.

We'll be using Ubuntu Linux, a Unix-like operating system.


# The Unix shell

One of the core aspects of the Unix environment is the _Unix shell_.

The shell is just a wrapper around the operating system, through which we can use text commands and output to interact with our computer.

This is analogous to the desktop environment on your personal computer, which has a graphical rather than a textual user interface.


# Remote servers

Unix was built for remote access, since computers were big and expensive.


# Why we care about remote servers

* The Hutch servers are really powerful
* We can leave long running computations running without worrying about our computer shutting down by necessity or accident
* We can access running programs and data from any computer capable of connecting to the remote server
* We can distribute tasks across compute clusters, such as the one the hutch has (See [gizmo class](http://www.fredhutch.io/events/2015/05/20/spring-2015-unix-hpc/))


# Questions?


# Practicum!

* Connect to a remote server
* Unix survival guide
* Set up a project directory and load it with data
* Learn how to edit files on a server
* Tmux for session management
* Play with some data


# SSH for remote connection

Do this however you figured out how to do it for your OS.

```
ssh <username>@rhino
```

Write down which rhino you connect to, so you can directly connect to that next time.

(e.g If you get connected to `rhino03`, next time use `ssh <username>@rhino03`.)


# You're now in a Unix shell!

We'll cover things more thoroughly next class.
For now, just some basic information for orientation.


# Brief overview of a Unix command

`command [flags] [operands]`

```
ls -a ~
```

* `ls`: The command, in this case for listing directory contents
* `-a`: A flag which specifies that hidden files should be listed
* `~`: An operand, in this case a special symbol which points to your home directory

Note: Spaces are important here (but not how many).


# Getting help for a Unix command

Most Unix programs will take either a `-h`, `--help`, or `-help` flag and return useful information about how to construct a valid command.

Some commands also have _man pages_, which you can access using `man <command-name>`.

Example: `ls --help` & `man ls`


# Stuck in a terminal?

If you are in the terminal and things seem "stuck" (a program is running that won't stop), try the following:

`Ctrl-c`, `Esc`, `q`, `Ctrl-d`


# Time to set up our project directory

This class will build around analysis of a single data set, so let's set up a project directory for it.

```bash
mkdir ~/bioinfclass

cd ~/bioinfclass
pwd

mkdir data output scripts

ls
```

(You'll always enter in the things you see in these black boxes)


# Download data with `wget`

```bash
wget https://goo.gl/8Nk5tZ -o data.tar
ls
```

Note that we now have a `data.tar` file in this directory.
This is an archive type (like `zip`) common on Unix systems.
To unpack it

```bash
tar -vxf data.tar
```


# Editing text files with `nano`

Type `nano README.md` to open a new text file called `README.md`

```bash
nano README.md
```

You are now in the `nano` text editing program.
Type your thoughts about the class so far...

To save, type `Ctrl-o` and hit enter.
To exit type `Ctrl-x` (if there are unsaved changes, next type `y` then `Enter` to save them).



# Let's look at what we've done

`tree` prints out a directory tree as ASCII art.

```bash
tree
```

Note: This may not turn out right on Windows PuTTY terminals.


# Let's explore the sequence file

`cat` prints the output of file(s) to the screen.

```bash
cat data/sfv.fasta
```


# Now with `less`

`less` lets us "page" through data, without flooding the screen.

```bash
less data/sfv.fasta
```

<br/>

Press the `q` key to exit from `less`.


# Now let's look at the metadata

```bash
less data/sfv.csv
```

Press the `/` key to enter a search string

(Try `human` or `monkey`; Use `n` and `N` to toggle through results).


# Questions?


# Supercharging our shell

SciComp has set up a _module_ system for customizing your environment.

We'll be using the `intro-bio` module, loaded by executing `module load intro-bio` (note: this *only affects the current shell session!*).
When you do this, you should see something like:

```bash
module load intro-bio
```

You might get a message that says `Using already loaded python`, but don't worry about it.
If you get an error message though, let us know. 
You can't proceed without this module loaded.


# Module system side note

**Note:** if you _ever_ get a "command not found" error, you probably need to re-load your modules.


# Tmux - Terminal multiplexer

This is a tool that let's us have multiple Unix shells running at once.

We could just open multiple terminal windows, each with an ssh connection into the remote server.
But with tmux, if we close or lose our connection to the server, our terminal session doesn't get killed; running programs keep running.
This let's us:

* Put down and pick up work from multiple machines
* Keep working on other things while a long running computation runs
* Switch back and forth quickly between multiple projects


# Setting up tmux

We'll use tmux throughout this class to keep sessions running.
But first let's download a nice tmux configuration file for making things easier.

```bash
# This is a command that download
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredhutchio/intro-bioinformatics/gh-pages/config/tmux.conf

ls

# tmux knows to look for our config file at ~/.tmux.conf
mv tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

# Note that this file is hidden once we make it a "dotfile"
ls ~
ls -a ~
```


# Starting a new tmux session

    tmux

You should now see a fresh shell session inside of tmux.


# Quick tmux cheatsheet

* `Ctrl-a` - your "Command key"
* `Ctrl-a ?` - Help
* `Ctrl-a d` - Detach session

Windows:

* `Ctrl-a c` - New window
* `Ctrl-a <Space>` - Next window


# Quick tmux cheatsheet

Panes:

* `Ctrl-a |` - Split window into panes vertically
* `Ctrl-a -` - Split window into panes horizontally
* `Ctrl-a <arrow>` - Move between 
* `Ctrl-d` - Close a pane or window


# Tmux commands

You can also interact with tmux using commands, and you can see a lit of commands and explanations on the man page:

```
man tmux
```

All of the key combos above are just bindings to these commands, so this is a good place to go if you're trying to figure something out.

You can also type `tmux ` and hit `<Tab>` to see a list of commands (this will autocomplete if you type the first part of the command; try `tmux kill-` then `<Tab>`).


# Lets put Tmux to the test

And also do our first sequence alignment!


# What is a sequence alignment?


# Making a sequence alignment

```bash
# First start the long running alignment
cd ~/bioinfclass
muscle -maxiters 2 -in data/sfv.fasta -out output/alignment.fasta

# Get bored waiting and want to work on something else...
<Ctrl-a |> # create new pane

cd ~
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
mkdir data output scripts
```


# Detaching and attaching a tmux session

1. Close your terminal window, and ignore any warning prompts.
2. Reconnect just the way you did at the beginning of the class.
3. Type `tmux attach` to attach to an existing session.

**Remember:** `tmux attach` will fail if you don't have a session open already; if that happens just enter `tmux` to start a new session.


# Manual detach

While in tmux, we can explicitly detach by typing `tmux detatch`.

Try doing this and then reattaching.


# Questions?


# Homework

Please, _please_, _**please!**_

Go over `tmux` and `nano` and memorize the basics of how to use them.
We'll use these tools over and over and this will help keep things moving.
