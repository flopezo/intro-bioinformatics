# The Shell

* Philosophy
* Tools
* Cluster computing


# The Unix Philosophy

* Small, composable tools that do one thing right
* Plumb tools together into pipelines/scripts
* Embrace plain text/data

This gives us a lot of power.


# Let's break things down a bit


# Directories, files and paths, oh my!

In which we see the static world of things.


# In Unix, (almost) everything is a file

* programs
* devices
* /dev/null
* etc.


# And files have **paths**

Paths are the addresses for files, and are based on _directories_.


# Directories (aka "folders") are containers

## ...for more directories and files...


# Some special paths & directories:

* `/` - The "root" of the filesystem; everything lives here
* `.` - Current directory (depends on where you are)
* `..` - Parent directory (depends on where you are)
* `~` - Home directory


# How paths work

If we have a directory called `bioinfclass` in the directory `~`, the path to this directory is `~/bioinfclass`.

If `bioinfclass` has a subdirectory called `data`, it's path is `~/bioinfclass/data`.


# Path tools

* change directories with `cd`
* list directory contents with `ls`
* see where we are with `pwd`


# Example: Using path tools

```
cd ~

pwd

# list the contents of this directory
ls bioinfclass/data

cd bioinfclass

pwd

ls data
```


# Exercise: going up the directory chain

Try

```
ls ..

ls ../..

cd /
```

**Excecise:** Where are we now? How can we get back to our home directory?


# We can change the path of a file using `mv`

```
mv bioinfclass/data foobar

ls

ls foobar

ls bioinfclass
```

**Excercise:** How do we get `data` back?


# `mv` is for renaming as well

If the directory of the file is the same, we just _rename_ the file, but the command stays the same.

```
mv bioinfclass foobar

ls

mv foobar bioinfclass
```


# We can make new directories or files with `mkdir` and `touch`

* `mkdir name` will create a directory `name`
* `touch name` will create a file `name`

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** create a file in a subdirectory from your home directory


# Commands

In which the things take flight and evolve!


# Anatomy of a Unix command

`command [flags] [operands]`

* command: name of the program
* operands: positional based arguments
    * often but not always required
* flags: named based arguments
    * position frequently ignored
    * usually for controlling details of program behavior
    * often not required
    * sometimes take arguments, sometimes not


# More on flag shape

* sometimes single dash and character (like `-h`)
* sometimes double dash and word (like `--help`)
* sometimes single dash and word (like `-help`; esp Java programs)
* sometimes there are short and long options (like `-h` or `--help`)
* sometimes short flags can be munged together (`-v -x -f the-file` == `-vxf the-file`)


# Help with flags

```
ls --help

```


# Getting help with `man` and `apropos`

There is built in help on the command line:

* Try `man ls` (arrows to scroll, q to quit)
* Try `apropos calculator`


# Programs are just files!

```
which tree

# -l: "long" list output; lots of info that we will ignore except for `x` presence/absence
ls -l /usr/bin/tree

# super secret shortcut
ls -l $(which tree)

touch testfile

# Notice no x; not executable...
ls -l testfile
```


# What else is in `/usr/bin`?

`ls /usr/bin` => LOTS OF STUFF!

This is one of the many places your shell looks for programs


# How does the shell know where to look for programs?

`echo $PATH` => `:` separated list of places your shell looks for programs.

This can be edited if you want to let your shell know to look other places as well (see `.bashrc`)


# Pipes and streams

In which our constructions in flight don tongues and communicate!


# A bit about `std` files

There are three special files that programs often read from and write to by default to facilitate composability:

^imghl "figures/stdfiles.svg" 300

For the most part we'll ignore `stderr`...


# By default, stdout gets printed to the screen

## But we can _redirect_ stdout to a file using `>`

`Program` vs `Program > out-file`

^imghl "figures/redirect.svg" 300


# Example of redirection

`FastTree -nt output/alignment.fasta`

vs

`FastTree -nt output/alignment.fasta > output/tree.nw`


# We can also `|` `stdout` of one command to `stdin` of another

`Prog1 | Prog2`:

^imghl "figures/pipe.svg" 300


# Example

`column -t -s , data/svf.csv | less -S`

* `column` writes it's output to `stdout`
* `less` reads from `/dev/stdin` if no file is specified


#
Programs have to _know_ to use stdin / stdout for this to work.
Some conventions:

* Assume first argument is input, second output
* If only one argument is specified, output to `stdout`
* If no arguments specified, input from `stdin`, output to `stdout`
* Sometimes there is no "output" argument; assume `stdout`
* Sometimes programs treat `-` as a shortcut for `stdin`
* When all else fails, you can read from & write to `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stdin` directly


# Practicum!

In which we apply our knowledge of these flying, speaking beasts.


# Let's look at our CSV data a bit more


# Head first...

```
head data/sfv.csv

column -t -s , data/sfv.csv | head
```


# How many humans are there?

```
grep human data/sfv.csv | wc -l

grep monkey data/sfv.csv | wc -l
```


# Another way we could do these together

How many sequences are there for each species?

```
cut -d , -f 3 data/sfv.csv | sort | uniq -c
```


# How about how many specimens there are per species?

```
# First, uniq specimens, with species info
cut -d , -f 2,3 data/sfv.csv | sort | uniq | head

# Next count that by species
cut -d , -f 2,3 data/sfv.csv | sort | uniq | cut -d , -f 2 | sort | uniq -c
```


# What about specimens by location?

```
cut -d , -f 2,3,5 data/sfv.csv | sort | uniq | cut -d , -f 2,3 | sort | uniq -c
```

Super powerful and fast.


# Is anyone else getting tired of all this `-d , -f 2,3,5` business?

## Enter `csvkit`

We have `csv...` versions of many of the standard Unix utils:

* csvcut
* csvgrep
* csvjoin
* csvlook
* csvsort
* csvstack
* csvstat


# Advantages of csvkit

* Can use header names, not just indices
* Don't have to specify `-s ,`/`-d ,` every time
* Headers are treated separately from the data


# Looking at just the human sequences

```
csvgrep -c species -m human data/sfv.csv | csvlook | less -S
```


# The one missing piece: csvuniq

```
# ~/bin is one of the places we can put programs
mkdir ~/bin

wget https://goo.gl/ZdNoUL -O ~/bin/csvuniq

# Need to let the shell know this should be executable
chmod +x ~/bin/csvuniq

# Have to install some dependencies
R
install.packages(c('optparse', 'plyr'))
```


# Now let's see what our example looks like:

```
csvuniq -c specimen,species,location data/sfv.csv | csvuniq -zc species,location | csvlook
```

Notice that `csvuniq` does all of the sorting and cutting for us...


# Let's finish our example from last week


# First let's take a look at our alignment

## Always do this!

```
# We'll use the `alnvu` program
av -L 99999 -w 99999 -c output/alignment.fasta | less -S
```


# Now we can look at our tree

```
FastTree -nt output/alignment.fasta > output/tree.nw

nw_display output/tree.nw | less -S
```


# Feedback

Was last week too much?
Would having taken things more slowly and foundationally like today have helped things?
